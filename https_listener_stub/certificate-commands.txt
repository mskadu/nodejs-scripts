# commands to generate private kays + self-signed certificates for the test

# 1. Use OpenSSL generate a 2048-bit RSA private key
openssl genrsa -out tls/localhost/localhost-privatekey.pem 2048

# 2. Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file for your private key
openssl req -new -sha256 -key tls/localhost/localhost-privatekey.pem -out tls/localhost/localhost-csr.pem

#3.  Create a self-signed certificate using the OpenSSL. Note: Skip if you have a CA who can do this for you
openssl x509 -req -in tls/localhost/localhost-csr.pem -signkey tls/localhost/localhost-privatekey.pem -out tls/localhost/localhost-public_cert.pem

# Summary - you should end up with the following 3 files (placed, for this test, under ./tls/localhost)

localhost-privatekey.pem	# your private key
localhost-csr.pem			# the CSR generated for your private key
localhost-public_cert.pem	# the self-signed public certificate
